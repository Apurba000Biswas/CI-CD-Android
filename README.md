# CI-CD-Android

### Problem :
1. Change in engineering in the team : one or more engineer can be added or removed any time so knowledge base need to transfer among the new teammates . which can efect the production.
2. Repository origin can be changed
3. Rsik of transferring knowledge of release management
4. Migrating platform

To solve those issue we can move into CI/CD
